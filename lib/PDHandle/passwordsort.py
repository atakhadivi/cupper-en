"""
The rules I currently use: the scoring system
Password length
Does the password have special characters?
Whether the password is all digital,No extra points at the beginning of 0
Whether the password is all lowercase letters or only the uppercase
Passwords starting with 0 are also deducted
If it is not the beginning of the whole number letter, add points
Whether the password is the second half of the first half of the letter
The password is the first half of the letter, the middle special character, the second half of the number

#The whole letter is only the end is a number according to http://www.freebuf.com/news/topnews/62052.html
